QoSify is simple daemon for setting up and managing CAKE along with a custom
eBPF based classifier that sets DSCP fields of packets.

It supports the following features:
- simple TCP/UDP port based mapping
- IP address based mapping
- priority boosting based on average packet size
- bulk flow detection based on number of packets per second
- dynamically add IP entries with timeout
- dns regex entries and ubus api for providing dns lookup results

It can be configured via ubus call qosify config.

This call supports the following parameters:
- "reset": BOOL
	Reset the config to defaults instead of only updating supplied values

- "files": ARRAY of STRING
	List of files with port/IP/host mappings

- "timeout": INT32
	Default timeout for dynamically added entries

- "dscp_default_udp": STRING
	Default DSCP value for UDP packets

- "dscp_default_tcp": STRING
	Default DSCP value for TCP packets

- "dscp_prio": STRING
	DSCP value for priority-marked packets

- "dscp_bulk": STRING
	DSCP value for bulk-marked packets

- "dscp_icmp": STRING
	DSCP value for ICMP packets

- "bulk_trigger_pps": INT32
	Number of packets per second to trigger bulk flow detection

- "bulk_trigger_timeout": INT32
	Time below bulk_trigger_pps threshold until a bulk flow mark is removed

- "prio_max_avg_pkt_len": INT32
	Maximum average packet length for marking a flow as priority

- "interfaces": TABLE of TABLE
	netifd interfaces to enable QoS on

- "devices": TABLE of TABLE
	netdevs to enable QoS on


interface/device properties:
- "bandwidth_up": STRING
	Uplink bandwidth (same format as tc)

- "bandwidth_down": STRING
	Downlink bandwidth (same format as tc)

- "ingress": BOOL
	Enable ingress shaping

- "egress": BOOL
	Enable egress shaping

- "mode": STRING
	CAKE diffserv mode

- "nat": BOOL
	Enable CAKE NAT host detection via conntrack

- "host_isolate": BOOL
	Enable CAKE host isolation

- "autorate_ingress": BOOL
	Enable CAKE automatic rate estimation for ingress

- "ingress_options": STRING
	CAKE ingress options

- "egress_options": STRING
	CAKE egress options

- "options": STRING
	CAKE options for ingress + egress


Mapping file syntax:

Each line has two whitespace separated fields, match and dscp
match is one of:
- tcp:<port>[-<endport>]
	TCP single port, or range from <port> to <endport>
- udp:<port>[-<endport>]
	UDP single port, or range from <port> to <endport>
- <ipaddr>
	IPv4 address, e.g. 1.1.1.1
- <ipv6addr>
	IPv6 address, e.g. ff01::1
- dns:<pattern>
	fnmatch() pattern supporting * and ? as wildcard characters
- dns:/<regex>
	POSIX.2 extended regular expression for matching hostnames
	Only works, if dns lookups are passed to qosify via the add_dns_host ubus call.
- dns_c:...
	Like dns:... but only matches cname entries

dscp can be a raw value, or a codepoint like CS0
Adding a + in front of the value tells qosify to only override the DSCP value if it is zero
DNS entries are compared in the order in which they are specified in the config, using the
first matching entry.


Planned features:
- Support for LAN host based priority
